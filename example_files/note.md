Every solution screenshot should be a JPG image with 50% quality, 50% scale and cropped to the relevant content. It is allowed for one box to be missing.

The current ones are taken from the Nonogram game by DoMobile and scaled, cropped and exported in Photoshop.

All file names should follow this rule (replace X with the next unused number):
- exampleX.csv
- exampleX_solution.jpg
