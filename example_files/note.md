Every solution screenshot should be a JPG image with 50% quality, 50% scale and cropped to the relevant content. It is allowed for one box to be missing.

All file names should follow this rule (replace X with the next unused number):
- exampleX.csv
- exampleX_solution.jpg

The current ones are taken from the Nonogram game by DoMobile and scaled, cropped and exported in Photoshop.
